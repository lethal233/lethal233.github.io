**NEWS** [04/15/2024]: Our paper [Misconfiguration Software Testing for Failure Emergence in Autonomous Driving Systems](https://lethal233.github.io/files/fse24-final.pdf) has been accepted by [FSE '24](https://2024.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2024-research-papers/52/Misconfiguration-Software-Testing-for-Failure-Emergence-in-Autonomous-Driving-Systems).



Hello! I'm Shilong Li, a second-year Master student in Software Engineering at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). My research interests are autonomous driving systems and software testing and analysis.

In 2022, I hold a honored Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn)). I was doing research with Professor Yepang Liu.
