<!-- UPDATE: I am constructing a new personal page, and you can see a temporary version [here](https://shilonl.github.io). -->

Hello! I'm Shilong Li, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer currently pursuing my Master of Science in Software Engineering at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

I hold a honored Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn)). My technical expertise spans a wide range of programming languages including Java, Python, Golang, and several others. I'm also proficient in various frameworks and tools like Spring Boot, MyBatis, JUnit, Selenium, and more.

My professional journey includes a stint as a QA Intern at Authentic8 Inc., where I played a crucial role in enhancing product quality through manual and automated testing and contributing to the automation framework. At the University of California, Irvine, I've been making a difference as a Teaching Assistant/Grader, mentoring students and grading assignments for a class of over 200.

Previously, I interned as a Software Engineer at Lakala Payment Co. Ltd., where I helped develop a test automation framework, significantly improved application efficiency, and contributed to a more efficient CI/CD pipeline.

I have also undertaken several impactful projects. These include developing a Search Engine using Django and Vue.js, creating a Record and Replay Framework for Web Testing, contributing to open-source projects, and architecting an Online Assessment System.

I'm always eager to apply my skills to challenging problems and contribute to the advancement of technology in software engineering.

 <!-- Hi welcome to my page! This is Shilong Li. I am now a Master of Science in Software Engineering student in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) of [Donald Bren School of Informatics & Computer Sciences](https://www.ics.uci.edu/) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). In 2022, I obtained my B. Eng. Degree in Computer Science and Technology with honor from the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn). I have experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Lakala Payment Co., Ltd., where I contributed to constructing an automated testing framework and enhancing the system's security. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at SUSTech, I was involved in various research projects spanning web testing, empirical software studies, and cross-disciplinary studies.

My technical skills include various programming languages, frameworks, and tools such as Java, Python, Golang, SQL, C/C++, Kotlin, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Spring Boot, MyBatis, JUnit, Selenium, Soot, Heros, Git, Maven, Gradle, Docker, Django, Apollo, Redis, Vim, AWS, WireShark, mitmproxy, TravisCI, React, Node.js, and Vue.js. These skills enable me to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

I have worked on numerous projects, including the development of a Simple Search Engine that efficiently crawled, stored, and ranked websites; Fuzzy Replay for Web UI Testing, which improved the automation and effectiveness of web testing; and making significant contributions to the open-source community by fixing issues in popular repositories. Other projects include Taxi Trip Visualization, Network Traffic Analysis for monitoring and securing network traffic, and the creation of Phantom OJ, an online assessment system that streamlines grading and offers a multi-secured, multi-authority environment. My work demonstrates a strong background in software engineering, programming, and research, showcasing my ability to tackle diverse challenges in the field. -->
