 I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology with honor from the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) in 2022. I have done many interesting projects about software testing and analysis at SUSTech. In 2022 Fall, I will pursue my M.S. degree at the UC Irvine. I am very looking forward to further study!
