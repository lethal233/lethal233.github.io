Intro to empirical study.

## Empirical Standards

Refer to [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards Released](https://doi.org/10.1145/3437479.3437483)

### How do standards benefits me?

1. to review the paper
2. to highlight the quality of my own research (e.g. "our experiment meets all of the essential criteria laid out by the SIGSOFT Empirical Standards")
3. as a pre-submission checklist->highlight all the best
